﻿/*
 Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns 
 its product sum. A "special" array is a non-empty array that 
 contains either integers or other "special" arrays. The 
 product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its 
 elements, where "special" arrays inside it should be 
 summed themselves and then multiplied by their level 
 of depth. For example, the product sum of [x, y] is 
 x + y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]] is x + 2y + 2z.
 
 Sample input: [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]

 Sample output: 12 (calculated as: (5 + 2 + 2 * (7 - 1) + 3 + 2 * (6 + 3 * (-13 + 8) + 4)))
